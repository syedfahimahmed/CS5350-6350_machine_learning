This is a machine learning library developed by Syed Fahim Ahmed for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

For Linear Regression
- go to Linear Regression folder
- bash run.sh to generate results batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and analytical gradient descent.


Similarly,
For Ensemble Learning
- go to Ensemble Learning folder
- bash run.sh to generate results adaboost, bagging tree and random forest


For Perceptron
- go to Perceptron folder
- bash run.sh to generate results for standard, voted and average perceptron respectively.
- voted percentron weights are saved in voted_weights_count.txt file

For SVM
- go to SVM folder
- bash run.sh to generate results for different learning rates, C and linear, non-linear(gaussian kernel) SVM

For Neural Networks
- go to Neural Networks folder
- bash run.sh to generate results for Scratch Ann and PyTorch Ann

For Logistic Regression
- go to Logistic Regression folder
- bash run.sh to generate results for Logistic Regression (MAP and MLE)

There is a run.sh file for eash folder
